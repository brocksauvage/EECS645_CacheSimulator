       \UHHHHHHHH
              Unicode character with hex value HHHHHHHH (8 digits)

       %%     a single %

       %b     ARGUMENT  as  a string with '\' escapes interpreted, except that octal
              escapes are of the form \0 or \0NNN

       %q     ARGUMENT is printed in a format that can be  reused  as  shell  input,
              escaping non-printable characters with the proposed POSIX $'' syntax.

       and  all C format specifications ending with one of diouxXfeEgGcs, with ARGU‚Äê
       MENTs converted to proper type first.  Variable widths are handled.

       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of printf, which usually supersedes
       the  version  described here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation for
       details about the options it supports.
